# InfniteMonkey

Like the modified branch this one builds on the previous best randomly generated string but except this time, non-matching characters are changed one at a time with a random letter, instead of all at once.

As a result, this version of the program takes a lot more iterations than the other modified branch version.

Nonetheless, the program is still able to reach the goal of matching the string.
