# InfiniteMonkey

Simulation of the Infinite Monkey Theorem for a string of 28 characters utilizing the random module in Python.

The program generates a random string of 28 characters everytime and tries to match it to the string: "methinks it is a weasel".

It runs until the random string generated finally matches the goal string, which does not happen in our scope of a reasonable time. 

Improvements/modifications can/will be made to improve on the process of matching, although doing so will deviate from the original statement from the actual theorem (complete randomness).

Modifications will be in a separate branch as to keep this one intact since it is, technically, the closest imitation of a monkey randomly typing letters forever.
